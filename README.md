# Task Tracker

Task Tracker is a very simple todo app, that I made as an introduction to Vue and Bootstrap. This is a modified version of the Traversy Media [Vue Crash Course](https://youtu.be/qZXt1Aom3Cs).

## Technologies Used

This app is written in JavaScript with Vue.js. I used Vuex for state management, Bootstrap and SCSS for styling, and JSON Server for prototyping a mock back-end.

## Functionality

The user can see a list of saved tasks, add tasks, toggle a green highlight with a double-click of the task, and delete tasks. There is no login function as of now, so all users will see the same list of tasks.
